"""
Launches triply.CT_visualization_window's interactive viewer as a
separate process for a given .mhd file already on disk. Shared by
app/pages/3_CT_Analysis.py (loaded volume) and app/components/ct_pipeline.py
(processed mask preview) so the subprocess/backend-forcing logic and the
full-vs-lightweight toggle only live in one place.

Two viewer modes, both from CT_visualization_window.py:
- Full (open_window): brush/rainbow/histogram tooling, scroll-to-scrub.
- Lightweight (lightweigth_open): just a Z-slice slider + click-to-inspect
  greyvalues - opens faster and uses less memory, handy for a quick look
  or for large volumes where the full toolset isn't needed.

Split into a toggle (render_lightweight_toggle) and a launcher
(launch_ct_viewer) rather than one combined button, so callers that need
to do work before launching (e.g. ct_pipeline.py writing a temp .mhd for
the current result) can keep that work gated behind their own "open
viewer" button click instead of it re-running on every page rerun.

    ============================================================================
    3) CT_HISTOGRAM
    Renders a greyvalue histogram from an already-computed (hist,
    bin_edges) pair - e.g. from app.pages.3_CT_Analysis._load_histogram,
    which caches that computation separately, keyed on (mhd_path, bins)
    rather than on the volume array itself (hashing a full CT volume on
    every rerun would cost more than just recomputing the histogram - see
    that function's docstring). Kept as a pure "given numbers, draw a
    chart" function so the (cached) computation and the (cheap, always-
    rerun) rendering stay decoupled, the same way _build_result_fig and
    _run_pipeline are decoupled in ct_pipeline.py.

    Renders via Plotly + st.plotly_chart, matching every other figure in
    this app (see the Heatmap previews in 3_CT_Analysis.py/ct_pipeline.py/
    equation_input.py) - a bare matplotlib plt.show(), which this used to
    call, has nowhere to display to inside the Streamlit server process
    and never reaches the browser at all.
