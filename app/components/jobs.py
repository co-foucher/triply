"""
Minimal background-job runner for long-running pipeline steps (fTetWild
meshing, ABAQUS simulation).

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
Streamlit reruns the entire script top-to-bottom on every widget
interaction and blocks the UI while a script run is in progress. The
simulation pipeline shells out to external, long-running processes
(fTetWild, ABAQUS - see triply.TET_mesh_tools / abaqus_tools), so
calling them directly from a button handler would freeze the app for the
duration of the run. Instead, `start_job` runs the work in a background
thread and stores its live status/log in st.session_state.

    Runs `fn(*args, log=job.append_log, **kwargs)` in a background thread.

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    jobs : dict
        Registry to store the Job in - pass st.session_state["jobs"].
    label : str
        Human-readable label shown in the UI (e.g. "mesh:my_tpms").
    fn : callable, i.e. a function
        this function will be called in a background thread, 
        and it must accept a `log(str) -> None` keyword argument for progress messages.
        (see app/pages/2_Simulation.py for examples).
    *args : positional arguments
        all the argurments that need to be passed to `fn`.
        *args collects extra positional arguments — passed by position, no names, gathered into a tuple. 
    **kwargs : keyword arguments
        all the keyword arguments that need to be passed to `fn`.
        **kwargs collects extra keyword arguments — passed as name=value, gathered into a dict.
    
    NOTE:
    -----
    to undertand how *args and **kwargs work, consider the following example:

    def f(*args, **kwargs):
        print(args, kwargs)
    
    f(1, 2, x=3, y=4)
    # args = (1, 2)

    """
    ============================================================================
    1) RENDER_JOB_STATUS
    Shows a job's current status and log tail. Auto-polls every 2s (via
    st.fragment's run_every) so background-thread progress shows up without
    the user having to click anything - cheap because only this small
    fragment reruns, not the whole page. The "Refresh status" button is kept
    as a manual/immediate option (scoped to the fragment too, so it doesn't
    force a full-page rerun either).

    Takes `job_id_key` (a session_state key, e.g. "abaqus_job_id") rather
    than an already-resolved Job. The button that starts a job usually lives
    in its OWN sibling fragment (see app/pages/2_Simulation.py -
    render_create_abaqus_section / render_run_abaqus_section) - it sets
    st.session_state[job_id_key] but, being a fragment-scoped rerun, does
    NOT re-run this function's call site. If this function were handed an
    already-resolved `job` object instead, that argument would stay frozen
    at whatever it was on the last FULL page rerun (typically None, since
    no job had started yet) - run_every would then keep re-rendering that
    same stale None forever, never picking up the newly-started job. Doing
    the `jobs.get(st.session_state.get(job_id_key))` lookup INSIDE this
    fragment's own body instead means every rerun of THIS fragment (the
    2s timer, or the Refresh button) re-reads current session_state, so it
    always finds the live job once one exists.
    ============================================================================

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    jobs : dict

        "mesh_job_id", "abaqus_job_id", "run_job_id"). Looked up fresh on
