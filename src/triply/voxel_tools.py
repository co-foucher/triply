    1) DETECT_OVERHANGS
    Detects overhang voxels in a 3D voxel grid by comparing each slice to the
    previous one and flagging transitions whose implied angle exceeds a given
    threshold. Overhang voxels that are actually bridged (supported on two
    roughly opposite sides within the allowed bridging distance) are
    reclassified as safe bridges rather than true overhangs.
    ============================================================================

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    voxel_grid : (nx, ny, nz) ndarray
        3D binary voxel grid, where each element is either 0 (empty) or
        1 (solid).
    x : (nx,) ndarray
        1D or 3D array of voxel coordinates along x. Used to compute voxel size.
    y : (ny,) ndarray
        1D or 3D array of voxel coordinates along y. Used to compute voxel size.
    z : (nz,) ndarray
        1D or 3D array of voxel coordinates along z. Used to compute voxel size.
    angle : float, optional
        Overhang angle threshold in degrees (default = 45.0). Suspicious
        voxels with an implied angle greater than this value are flagged as
        overhangs.
    bridge : float, optional
        Maximum bridgeable span, in the same physical units as x/y/z
        (default = 10). An overhang voxel found to be supported on two
        roughly opposite sides within this total span is reclassified as a
        bridge instead of a true overhang.
    n_bridge_angles : int, optional
        Number of ray directions (spanning 0-180 degrees, since each is
        tested in both the direction and its opposite) used to search for
        bridge support around each candidate voxel (default = 8, i.e. every
        22.5 degrees).

    RETURNS
    -------
    overhang_grid : (nx, ny, nz) ndarray
        Array of the same shape as voxel_grid, where each element is:
            0 (not solid), 
            1 (solid, not an overhang), 
            2 (overhang), or
            3 (bridge - unsupported but spanned between two supports within the
                allowed bridging distance, safe to print without support).
            4 (support voxel added to support an overhang above, if add_support_voxels=True).

    RAISES

    6) FIND_OPTIMAL_ORIENTATION
    Searches for the build orientation that minimizes overhangs. Candidate
    build directions are sampled roughly evenly over the sphere (golden-angle
    spiral, `n` directions). For each candidate, voxel_grid is reoriented so
    that direction becomes the new +Z (build) axis via
    _get_rotation_matrix_from_new_z_direction + _reorient_voxel_grid, then
    scored with detect_overhangs. The orientation with the lowest score is
    reoriented and re-classified once more and returned.
    ============================================================================

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    voxel_grid : (nx, ny, nz) ndarray
        3D binary voxel grid (0 = empty, 1 = solid).
    x, y, z : 1D or 3D ndarray
        Voxel coordinates along each axis (used to get the voxel pitch and
        origin). Must be evenly spaced.
    n : int, optional
        Number of candidate build directions to sample over the sphere
        (default = 20).
    overhang_angle : float, optional
        Overhang angle threshold in degrees, passed through to
        detect_overhangs as `angle` (default = 45).
    bridge_size : float, optional
        Maximum bridgeable span, passed through to detect_overhangs as
        `bridge` (default = 10).
    grid_sample_factor : float, optional
        Factor to scale the voxel size when re-rasterizing the rotated grid
        (default = 1.0).  A value > 1.0 will produce a large grid (less voxels).

    RETURNS
    -------
    overhang_grid : (nx', ny', nz') ndarray
        The detect_overhangs output (0/1/2/3 labels, see detect_overhangs)
        for the best-scoring orientation found, NOT the plain reoriented
        solid grid.
    new_x, new_y, new_z : 1D ndarray
        Coordinate arrays matching overhang_grid, for the reoriented (best)
        orientation. The winning direction vector / rotation matrix itself
        is not returned.

    NOTE
    ----
    Each candidate's score is np.sum(overhangs == 2) + np.sum(overhangs == 3),
    i.e. true overhangs and bridges are weighted equally.
